# Linux kernel with Heap Pre-allocation
Prototypical implementation of a heap pre-allocation in the scope of my Master's thesis titled: "Optimization of Memory Provisioning in a Plan-Based High Performance Computing Operating System".

Forked from the official Linux Github [repository](https://github.com/torvalds/linux).

I also left some comments and commented out kernel prints that helped my to navigate through the source code of page fault handling, `brk`, `exec` system call, and memory allocations.
